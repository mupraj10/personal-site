                                I am Maggy. Resident of NYC. I am 25 years old. Graduating with a degree in Neuroscience, I knew my options were either medical school or getting a PhD. Both at the time sounded appealing. Post graduation I spent time working in a virology research lab going towards the PhD degree, yet at the same time had the opportunity to work at an Apple Store. Balancing both was hard and often made me conflicted with my next step in life. Getting an opportunity to spend time at the corporate headquarters of Apple, I interatced with a different side of technology. Being immersed in the culture and experince, I thought that software development was my next step in life. Learning a bit of Ruby on Rails on my own, I knew I needed structure. Getting in Grace Hopper Academy, an all women immersive coding bootcamp, was the best decision I made. Spending 13 weeks, amongst women who felt this was also a passion for them was not only comforting but motivating. After graduating, I was selected to be a teaching fellow for the next cohort.

                                Moving forward, I would like to working/programming at a company whose mission I can resonate with. Coming from a science background and always trying to find a way to incorporate it in my work, I would be especially thrilled to work for a company asscioated with the biological/pyschological sciences as well as healthcare. I truly believe I am a life long learner and therefore am open to any opportunites.
